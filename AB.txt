Opening a New File
Step 1 type vim filename (create a file named filename)
Step 2 type i ( switch to insert mode)
Step 3 enter text (enter your Ada program)
Step 4 hit Esc key (switch back to command mode)
Step 5 type :wq (write file and exit vim)

Step 2 move around the file using h/j/k/l key or any appropriate command

1. List all process in current shell.
• $ ps
2. Display every active processes
• $ ps -A
• $ ps -e
3. Display all process and process not associated with terminal
• $ ps -au or
• $ ps -aux
a - list the processes of all the users
u - to provide detailed information about each process
x - add to the list process that have no controlling terminal, such as daemon, which are
programs, that are launched during booting and run in the background until they are
activated by the particular event.
4. To perform full-format listing.
• $ ps -ef OR $ ps -eF
5. To select all the process owned by the user.
• $ ps -x
6. To display users, process by real user id or name.
• $ ps -fu guesttc (your username)
OR
• $ ps -fu 1002 (to see the user id: id -u username)
7. To Display root process
• $ ps -fu root
OR
• $ ps -fu 0
8. Display Group process
• $ ps -fg guesttc
OR
• $ ps -fg 1008
to find the group id getent group | grep mygroup) or (cat /etc/group | grep mygroup)
9. Display process by PID and PPID
• $ ps -fp 1588 - Select process by ppid
• $ ps -f --ppid 1587 - Make Selection Using PID List
• $ ps -fp 1394,1587
10. Print process tree
• $ ps -e --forest
From this tree we can identify which is the parent process and the child process it forked
in a recursive manner.
To print the process tree for a given process.
• $ ps -f --forest -C sshd ( -C for command )
OR
• $ ps -ef --forest | grep sshd
11. Print Process Threads
• $ ps -fL -C sshd
Output:
LWP: Light Weight Process
NLWP: Number of Light Weight Process
12. Troubleshoot Linux System Performance.
To find top running process
• $ ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head
pass the line number as -n parameter.
• $ ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head -n 15
If you want to sort by cpu value
• $ ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head
If you want to stop any process that is consuming high cpu time
• $ kill -o pid
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$dbusername = "root";
$dbpassword = "Testwebpw1$";
$dbname = "myDB";
//Create Connection
$conn = new mysqli ($host, $dbusername, $dbpassword,
$dbname);
$username = $_POST['uname'];
$password = $_POST['upassword'];
//Insert value in database table
$sql = "INSERT INTO user (name, password) values
('$username', '$password')";
if($conn->query($sql)){
echo "New record is inserted successfully";
}
else {
echo "Error: ". $sql . "<br>". $conn->error;
}
$conn->close();

1. Check/Display all available network interface
• $ip link show
2. Identifying Ethernet Interfaces
• $sudo ip a OR $ip a
[Loopback address is a software address (127.0.0.1)]
• $sudo ip addr OR $ip addr
• $sudo lshw –class network
[Detailed hardware information about network cards on Linux]
3. Check the current IP of the server
• $ifconfig
4. Temporary IP address assignment
1) Temporary IP address assigning (This will work on real environment & it is not
physically connected to the network)
$sudo ip addr add 10.0.2.20/24 dev enp0s3
$sudo ip link set dev enp0s3 down
$sudo ip link set dev enp0s3 up
$ip address show dev enp0s3
2) Configure Default gateway
$sudo ip route add default via 10.0.2.1
$sudo ip route show (to see the default gateway)
3) Add temporary DNS Client address
✓ Edit /etc/resolv.conf
$sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
Add nameserver 8.8.8.8
4) To delete all IP configuration
$sudo ip addr flush enp0s3
5. Static IP Address assignment.
• Go to netplan directory
$cd /etc/netplan
• List out the contents in the netplan
$ll

Open the .yaml file
$sudo vi 00-installer-config.yaml

Then apply the changers
$sudo netplan apply
• See the IP address by giving the command “ifconfig”
$ifconfig

Dynamic IP Address Assignment (DHCP)
To configure your server to use DHCP dynamic address assignment
• open the file “/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml”
$sudo vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
Keep the dhcp4 = true
Save the file and exit
• Apply the changes on configuration by giving the command “netplan apply”
$sudo netplan apply
